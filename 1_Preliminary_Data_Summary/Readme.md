### Overview
The project initiated a partnership between Automatidata and the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) to build a predictive regression model for taxi fares. In this phase, the focus was on preliminary data inspection to assess data quality and identify relevant features for modeling.

### Key Accomplishments
- Flagged anomalies in the `total_amount` variable (e.g., high charges for short trips).
- Identified key predictive variables such as `trip_distance` and `total_amount`.
- Evaluated interactions between `total_amount` and `trip_distance`, considering components like tips and tolls.
- Reviewed supporting variables like `payment_type` and `passenger_count`.
- Set the foundation for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and future model development.

### Key Insights
- The dataset contains meaningful variables essential for predicting ride fares.
- Anomalous data points, such as expensive short-distance rides, indicate a need for further investigation.

### Next Steps
- Examine fare components like `RatecodeID`, `tip_amount`, `extra`, and `mta_tax`.
- Conduct comprehensive EDA and descriptive statistics.
- Clean the data and build a regression model.
- Validate and refine the model for improved accuracy.
