    "# Project Context: Automatidata and NYC TLC\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is being undertaken by a data professional at Automatidata, a data consulting firm. The current project for the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (NYC TLC) has reached its midpoint, with the completion of a project proposal, initial Python coding work, and exploratory data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "A new request has been received from the New York City TLC, communicated by Uli King, Automatidata’s project manager. This request involves analyzing the relationship between fare amount and payment type. Subsequently, a follow-up assignment from Luana, a senior data analyst, specifies the need to conduct an A/B test to address this request.\n",

    "# Statistical Analysis Project: A/B Testing and Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "This activity focuses on applying statistical methods to analyze and interpret data, covering fundamental concepts such as descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing. The provided data will be explored, and A/B tests, along with hypothesis testing, will be conducted.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project Purpose:** The purpose of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in preparing, creating, and analyzing A/B tests. The A/B test results are intended to identify strategies for increasing revenue for taxi cab drivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note on Data Assumption:** For the scope of this exercise, it is assumed that the sample data originates from an experiment where customers were randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1) customers required to pay with a credit card, or 2) customers required to pay with cash. This assumption is crucial for drawing causal conclusions regarding how payment method influences fare amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project Goal:** The goal is to apply descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing using Python. Specifically, the objective of this A/B test is to sample data and analyze whether a relationship exists between payment type and fare amount. For example, the analysis aims to discover if customers who use credit cards tend to pay higher fare amounts than customers who use cash.\n",
    "\n",
    "This activity is structured into four parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 1: Imports and Data Loading**\n",
    "* **Necessary Data Packages for Hypothesis Testing:** The essential packages for conducting hypothesis testing include `numpy` for numerical operations, `pandas` for data manipulation, and functions from `scipy.stats` for statistical tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 2: Conduct EDA and Hypothesis Testing**\n",
    "* **Contribution of Descriptive Statistics to Data Analysis:**\n",
    "    Descriptive statistics are valuable for quickly exploring and understanding large datasets.\n",
    "    * **Mean:** The mean (average) provides a general indication of the typical fare in the dataset, offering insight into the overall trend of the data. While useful for understanding the average amount customers are paying, it can be influenced by outliers.\n",
    "    * **Median:** The median represents the \"middle\" fare when the data is sorted. Its utility lies in its robustness to extreme values, providing a more accurate reflection of the typical fare in the presence of outliers.\n",
    "    * **Standard Deviation:** The standard deviation quantifies the dispersion or variability of fares around the mean. A small standard deviation suggests consistency in fares, while a large standard deviation indicates greater spread and variation. This metric helps in understanding the consistency or variability of fares relative to the average.\n",
    "    * **Identifying Trends:** By computing and comparing the mean or median fare for both credit card and cash payments, trends can be identified. For instance, if the mean fare for credit card payments is higher than for cash payments, it suggests a tendency for credit card users to pay more on average.\n",
    "    * **Checking for Outliers:** Outliers can be identified by comparing the mean with the maximum and minimum values. Significant discrepancies between the mean and these extreme values suggest the presence of outliers—data points that deviate significantly from the usual pattern and may require further investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Formulation of Null and Alternative Hypotheses:**\n",
    "    The hypotheses for this A/B test are formulated as follows:\n",
    "    * **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** There is no difference in the average fare amount between credit card and cash payments.\n",
    "    * **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** Customers who use a credit card pay higher fare amounts than those who pay with cash.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 3: Communicate Insights with Stakeholders**\n",
    "* **Key Business Insights from the A/B Test:** What significant business insights emerged from the results of the A/B test?\n",
    "* **Proposed Business Recommendations:** Based on the test results, what actionable business recommendations can be proposed?\n",
    "\n",

    "**Utility of Descriptive Statistics in Analysis:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "Descriptive statistics are fundamental for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and play a crucial role in learning more about the data during this analytical stage.\n",
    "\n",
    " **In general, descriptive statistics are useful because they let you quickly explore and understand large amounts of data.**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **The mean (average)** gives us a general idea of the typical fare in the dataset. It’s useful for understanding the overall trend of the data. For example, when looking at taxi fares, the mean fare shows us the average amount customers are paying, providing a quick sense of the typical fare. However, the mean can be affected by very high or very low values (outliers), which is why it's often helpful to also consider the median and standard deviation for a fuller picture of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    " **Median:** The median tells us the \"middle\" fare when the data is sorted. It’s useful because it isn’t affected by extreme values, offering a more accurate reflection of the typical fare when there are outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    " **Standard Deviation:** The standard deviation shows how much the fares deviate (or vary) from the mean.If the standard deviation is small, it means the fares are mostly close to the mean (indicating consistency).If the standard deviation is large, it means the fares are more spread out, with some being much higher or lower than the mean (indicating more variation).In short, the standard deviation helps us understand how consistent or varied the fares are compared to the average fare.\n",
    "          \n",
    " **Identifying Trends:** When calculating the mean or median fare for both credit card and cash payments, we can compare these values to see if one payment method generally results in higher or lower fares. For example:If the mean fare for credit card payments is higher than for cash payments, this suggests that credit card users tend to pay more on average.Similarly, comparing the median fare for each payment type helps identify trends, especially when there are outliers, as the median is less affected by extreme values.\n",
    "          \n",
    "**Checking for Outliers:** To identify outliers, we compare the mean with the maximum and minimum values. Here's how this works:Maximum/Minimum Values: If the maximum or minimum values are far away from the mean, it suggests that there might be outliers. For example, if the average fare is 30, but the maximum fare is 1000 or the minimum fare is 1, these extreme values may not be typical and could be outliers.\n",
    "      \n",
    "**Mean vs. Range:** If there is a big difference between the mean and the maximum or minimum values, it suggests that most of the data points are close to the mean, but there are a few extreme values (either very high or very low) that are far from the mean. These extreme values could be outliers—values that don't follow the usual pattern of the data and might need further investigation.\n"

    "    It is important to consider why this A/B test project might not be entirely realistic in a real-world scenario and to acknowledge the assumptions made for this educational project. In a true A/B test, the groups must be randomly selected to ensure the results are fair and unbiased. However, in this specific scenario, the dataset does not reflect a real-world experiment where individuals were randomly assigned to use either cash or credit card for payment.\n",

    "    The project's premise assumes that, for the sake of the A/B test, riders were randomly grouped into two categories (cash vs. credit card) and instructed to pay using one specified method. In reality, passengers typically choose their payment method based on personal preference and availability (e.g., carrying sufficient cash or having a card). Therefore, the fundamental assumption of random assignment, which is crucial for drawing causal conclusions, does not align with how payment methods typically operate in real life.\n"
